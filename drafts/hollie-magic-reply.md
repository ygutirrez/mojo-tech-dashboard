Hey Hollie!

Ha — yeah, we're trading places with the cold this weekend! Perfect timing to escape to Mexico while y'all thaw out.

So here's the deal with Adminify: I've been running into the same lack of support issues. Reached out multiple times, crickets. At this point, I'm done waiting on them.

**The plan:** I'm moving everything over to my own GoHighLevel agency — **MagicFollowUp**. This gives us full control, direct support (from me), and no more middleman headaches.

**Next steps for you:**
1. Don't worry about Adminify — I'll handle the transition on my end
2. I'll get your subaccount set up in MagicFollowUp
3. Once it's ready, I'll send you login credentials and we'll port over any existing workflows/data
4. We'll schedule a quick call to walk through everything and get Magic live

Give me a few days to get the foundation set up, and I'll circle back with your access. Should be a much smoother experience going forward.

Stay warm up there! ☃️

Yoel
