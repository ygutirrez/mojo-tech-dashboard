Hi,

I am requesting to port out my business phone number **+1 (972) 584-1641** from my Adminify/GoHighLevel subaccount to a new provider.

Please provide the following information needed to complete the port:

1. **Letter of Authorization (LOA)** — or confirmation that I can submit one to my new provider
2. **Account Number** associated with this phone number
3. **PIN or Security Code** (if applicable)
4. **Twilio Account SID** (if the number is hosted via Twilio)
5. **Current carrier/provider** of record for this number

Additionally, please confirm:
- The billing name and address on file for this number
- Any outstanding balance that needs to be settled before porting

I understand porting typically takes 7-14 business days once initiated. Please process this request promptly as I am transitioning to a new platform.

If there are any forms I need to complete on my end, please send them over.

Thank you,

**Hollie**

*Note: If they push back or delay, Hollie can escalate by mentioning FCC regulations require carriers to release numbers upon valid port-out request.*
