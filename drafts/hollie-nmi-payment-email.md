# Email to Hollie — NMI Payment Processing Migration

Hey Hollie,

As we work on migrating you over to MagicFollowUp, I wanted to get some details on your payment processing setup so we can make sure everything transfers smoothly.

You mentioned you're using NMI for payments through Adminify. A few quick questions:

1. **Do you have direct login access to NMI?** (Separate from Adminify — like a portal at nmi.com or your payment processor's site)

2. **Who is the merchant account under?** Is it your business name, or was it set up through Adminify?

3. **Do you have customers with saved cards for recurring billing?** If so, roughly how many?

4. **Do you know if you have access to your NMI API credentials?** (Sometimes called Security Key or API Key)

If you have direct access to NMI, the transfer should be straightforward — we just connect your existing account to the new platform. If it was all set up through Adminify, we may need to get you set up with your own merchant account.

Let me know what you find and we'll go from there!

Thanks,
Yoel
