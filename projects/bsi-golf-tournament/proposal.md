# BSI Charity Golf Tournament Proposal

**Prepared by:** Yoel Gutierrez, Board Member

## The Opportunity

I'd like to propose that Bee Strong International host its first annual charity golf tournament. Golf tournaments are proven fundraisers — low financial risk, high visibility, and they attract corporate sponsors who might not otherwise engage with the organization.

## Projected Revenue (Conservative Year 1)

| Revenue Source | Units | Rate | Total |
|----------------|-------|------|-------|
| Player fees | 80 players | $200 | $16,000 |
| Hole sponsors | 12 holes | $750 | $9,000 |
| Title sponsor | 1 | $5,000 | $5,000 |
| Silent auction / raffle | — | — | $3,000 |
| **Gross Revenue** | | | **$33,000** |
| Course & catering | | | ($12,000) |
| Prizes, signage, misc | | | ($3,000) |
| **Net to BSI** | | | **$18,000** |

*Year 2-3 potential: $40,000-75,000 net as the event builds momentum and sponsor relationships.*

## Proposed Format

- **Format:** 4-person scramble (accessible for all skill levels)
- **Players:** 72-100 (18-25 teams)
- **Schedule:** Registration/breakfast → Shotgun start → Lunch reception → Awards & auction
- **Timing:** Fall 2026 (October/November) — ideal Miami weather, avoids summer heat

## What We Need to Move Forward

1. **Board approval** to proceed with planning
2. **Planning committee** — 3-5 volunteers to handle logistics
3. **Board commitment** to recruit sponsors and players from personal/professional networks
4. **Initial budget** — ~$2,000 for deposits (course, marketing materials)

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Approve concept at next board meeting
2. Form planning committee (I'm happy to lead or co-lead)
3. Secure venue and date (I can research 2-3 course options)
4. Begin sponsor outreach — 6 months lead time is ideal

## Why This Works for BSI

- **Low risk:** Expenses are modest; most costs can be covered by early sponsor commitments
- **Donor cultivation:** Gets BSI in front of corporate decision-makers in a relaxed setting
- **Repeatable:** Year 1 builds the foundation; revenue grows with reputation
- **Community visibility:** Local media often covers charity tournaments

**I'm happy to discuss further or answer any questions. If there's interest, I can bring a more detailed plan with venue options to the next meeting.**
