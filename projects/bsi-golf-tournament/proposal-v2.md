## The Opportunity

I'd like to propose that Bee Strong International host its first annual charity golf tournament. Golf tournaments are proven fundraisers that attract corporate sponsors and create lasting donor relationships. Based on comparable events like the Unique Vacations Golf Classic, there's significant revenue potential even in Year 1.
