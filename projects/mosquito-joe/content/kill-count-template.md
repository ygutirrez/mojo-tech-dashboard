## How to Calculate the Number

### Formula:
```
Weekly Kill Count = (Active Customers) × (Avg Mosquitoes/Treatment) × (Treatments/Week)
```

### Assumptions:
- ~400 active residential customers
- Average yard: 5,000-10,000 sq ft
- Estimated mosquitoes eliminated per treatment: 50,000-100,000
- Treatments per week: ~200 (varies by season)

### Weekly Estimate:
- Low season (winter): 5-10 million
- Peak season (summer): 30-50 million

**Just round to a believable big number.** The point is impact, not precision.
