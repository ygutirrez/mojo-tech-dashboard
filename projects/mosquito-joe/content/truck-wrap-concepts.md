# 🚚 MoJo Truck Wrap Concepts

## The Goal
Turn MoJo trucks into rolling billboards that people **photograph and share**. Current wraps are functional but forgettable. We want trucks that make people smile, take pictures, and remember the brand.

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start with 2 trucks** — Test concepts, see which gets most reactions
2. **Use different designs** — A/B test comedy vs. scoreboard
3. **Track results** — "How did you hear about us?" → "Saw your truck"
4. **Roll out winners** — Wrap remaining fleet with best performer

- Bumper sticker: "My other car also kills mosquitoes"
