# Mosquito Joe — Tech Upsell Spotter Guide
## See It. Say It. Report It.

Your job isn't to sell — it's to **spot opportunities** and **plant seeds**. The CSRs close the deal. But what you see in the field is gold.

---

## THE 3-STEP TECH PROCESS

| Step | What You Do |
|------|-------------|
| 1. **SEE IT** | Notice upsell triggers while you're on the property |
| 2. **SAY IT** | Drop a casual comment to the customer |
| 3. **REPORT IT** | Log it so CSR can follow up |

## WHAT TO LOOK FOR (Upsell Triggers)

### 🔺 UPGRADE TO PREMIUM (Tick & Flea)
- Dogs or cats in the yard
- Wooded areas bordering the property
- Tall grass or leaf litter
- Customer mentions kids playing in grass
- Deer spotted or deer droppings
- Customer mentions finding ticks

**Say this:** "Hey, just so you know — I noticed you've got some wooded area back there. Ticks love that. Might be worth asking about our Premium service that covers ticks too. Just something to think about."

---

### 🔺 UPGRADE TO BI-WEEKLY (From Monthly)
- Heavy shade / lots of trees
- Standing water (birdbaths, fountains, clogged gutters)
- Customer says "they're still pretty bad"
- Large property
- Near canals, lakes, retention ponds

**Say this:** "Your yard's got a lot of shade — mosquitoes love that. If you're still seeing a lot between visits, bi-weekly might knock it out. The office can tell you more."

---

### 🔺 SPECIAL EVENT SPRAY
- Party decorations going up
- Tents or rental equipment on property
- Customer mentions upcoming event
- Graduation signs
- Wedding prep visible

**Say this:** "Oh, you've got something coming up? We do a special event spray — extra strength, right before the party. Guarantees no mosquitoes for your guests. Want me to have the office call you about it?"

---

### 🔺 NATURAL / ORGANIC SERVICE
- Vegetable gardens
- Chicken coops
- Beehives
- "Organic" or eco-friendly signs/stickers
- Customer asks "what's in the spray?"
- Kids' play equipment everywhere

**Say this:** "I noticed your garden — just so you know, we have an all-natural option if you're trying to keep things organic. Same protection, just plant-based. Office can give you details."

---

### 🔺 ADDITIONAL PROPERTY / REFERRALS
- Customer mentions second home, rental, lake house
- Neighbors outside watching
- Customer mentions family/friends with mosquito problems

**Say this:** "If you've got another property you want covered, we can set that up. Also, we've got a referral thing — if your neighbor signs up, you both get a discount."

---

## HOW TO REPORT (After Every Job)

In your job notes or end-of-day report, include:

```
UPSELL SPOTTED:
- Customer: [Name / Address]
- What I saw: [Trigger - e.g., "dogs in yard, wooded border"]
- What I said: [Your seed comment]
- Suggested upsell: [Premium / Bi-weekly / Event / Natural]
- Customer reaction: [Interested / Maybe / Didn't engage]
```

**This gives CSRs ammo for the follow-up call.**

---

## SEED PHRASES (Keep It Casual)

The goal is NOT to sell. Just plant the idea.

| Situation | What to Say |
|-----------|-------------|
| General | "Just something to think about." |
| General | "The office can tell you more." |
| General | "Might be worth asking about." |
| If they're interested | "Want me to have them call you?" |
| If they ask price | "I'm not sure on price — but the office can get you a quote real quick." |

---

## DON'Ts

❌ Don't quote prices (you might be wrong)
❌ Don't push or be salesy (you're not the closer)
❌ Don't promise things (let CSR handle details)
❌ Don't skip reporting (your intel = CSR's ammo)

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

Every upsell you spot and report:
- Helps the company grow
- Could mean bonuses for the team
- Makes customers happier (right service for their needs)

**You see things the phone can't. Use it.**
