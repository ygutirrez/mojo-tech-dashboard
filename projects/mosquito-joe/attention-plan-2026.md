# MoJo Miami Attention Plan 2026

**Goal:** Become the mosquito company people *talk about* — not just another pest service.

---

## The Problem with "Marketing"

Everyone in Miami is doing:
- Google Ads → You're bidding against Terminix, Orkin, and 50 local guys
- Door hangers → Goes straight to trash
- Mailers → 0.5% response rate on a good day
- "10% off first treatment" → Boring, forgettable

**Result:** You're just noise in a crowded market.

## The Attention Mindset

> "You don't need a marketing plan. You need to do things worth marketing." — Seth Godin

Instead of asking "How do we reach more people?" ask:
**"What would make someone pull out their phone and share this?"**
