## Executive Summary

**The real story:** Revenue has been FLAT for 3 years. The 2025 "growth" was a one-time government contract (Alligator Alcatraz, ~$366K) that is now on hold and should not be counted as sustainable.

| Year | Reported | Adjusted (Sustainable) | Real Change |
|------|----------|------------------------|-------------|
| 2023 | $2,678,248 | $2,678,248 | — |

| 2025 | $3,027,366 | **~$2,661,000** | **FLAT** |

**The path forward:** $200K additional marketing budget allocated for 2026 to drive real growth.  
**Goal:** $5M revenue in 3-4 years (requires ~20% annual growth)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Alligator Alcatraz Adjustment

The $366K "Residential Pest" line in 2025 was **ONE government contract** (Alligator Alcatraz) — not organic growth. This contract:
- Is NOT long-term
- Is currently ON HOLD
- Should not be counted as sustainable revenue

**Adjusted Revenue (excluding one-time contract):**

| Year | Reported Revenue | Adjusted Revenue | Real YoY |
|------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| 2023 | $2,678,248 | $2,678,248 | — |
| 2024 | $2,660,198 | $2,660,198 | -0.7% |
| 2025 | $3,027,366 | **~$2,661,000** | **+0.03%** |

**Reality: THREE YEARS OF FLAT REVENUE.**

The core mosquito business is not growing. The 2025 "growth" was a windfall that masked the stagnation.

## Cost Analysis

### Direct Costs (COGS)

| Category | 2023 | 2025 | Change | Notes |
|----------|------|------|--------|-------|
| **Direct Labor** | $374,290 | $494,813 | +$120,523 (+32%) | ⚠️ Growing faster than revenue |
| **Auto/Fleet** | $146,076 | $233,046 | +$86,970 (+60%) | ⚠️ Big jump |

3. **Materials down 35%** — good cost control here

| Category | 2023 | 2025 | Change | Notes |

## 🚨 Red Flags & Areas of Concern

### 1. Marketing Spend Cut by 37%
- 2023: $265,552 (9.9% of revenue)
- 2025: $167,853 (5.5% of revenue)

**Why this matters:** If revenue has been "stagnant" as you mentioned, cutting marketing by $100K could be contributing to that. You may be starving growth.

**Question:** Was this intentional? Did ROI on marketing drop, or was this a cost-cutting decision?

### 2. Direct Labor Growing Faster Than Revenue
- Revenue: +13%
- Direct Labor: +32%

**Possible causes:**
- Wage inflation / paying more per tech
- Lower route density (more drive time)
- Less efficient scheduling
- Hiring ahead of growth that didn't materialize

**Action:** Review revenue per technician and jobs per day metrics

### 3. Auto/Fleet Costs Up 60%
- 2023: $146,076 (5.5% of revenue)
- 2025: $233,046 (7.7% of revenue)

Breakdown in 2025:
- Auto Insurance: $126,886 (up from $90K)
- Fuel: $45,451
- Maintenance: $32,381

**Action:** Your auto insurance jumped $37K. Shop this aggressively.

### 4. Royalty Fee % Doesn't Match
- 2023: $305,079 / $2,678,248 = **11.4%**
- 2025: $281,285 / $3,027,366 = **9.3%**

**Questions:**
- Why did royalty % drop?
- Was there a franchise agreement change?
- Or is some revenue not subject to royalty (misting equipment sales)?

### 5. Credit Card Fees Climbing
- 2023: $56,710 (2.1%)
- 2025: $70,910 (2.3%)

You're paying more despite rates generally being negotiable at your volume.

## Missing Data Needed

1. **2024 P&L** — Critical to see the trend (did revenue peak in 2024?)
2. **Customer count by year** — Are you losing customers or getting smaller tickets?
3. **Revenue per tech / jobs per day** — Labor efficiency metrics
4. **Marketing ROI data** — What did the $143K in PPC actually generate?
5. **AR Aging report** — Bad debt seems low, is AR piling up?

---

## Questions for Yoel

1. Why was marketing cut so significantly (9.9% → 5.5%)?
2. What happened in 2024? (Need that P&L)
3. Did franchise agreement change re: royalty calculation?
4. What's driving the auto insurance increase?
5. Are you tracking cost per new customer acquired?
