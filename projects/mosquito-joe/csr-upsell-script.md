## SCENARIO 1: New Customer Calls for One-Time Treatment

**Customer:** "Hi, I need a one-time mosquito spray."

**CSR:** "Absolutely, I can help with that. Quick question — what's going on that made you call today?"

**[Listen for: party coming up, kids getting bit, just moved in, etc.]**

**CSR:** "Got it. So here's the thing — I could book you a one-time, but honestly? I don't think that's what you need."

**[Pause]**

**CSR:** "Mosquitoes breed every 7-10 days. One spray kills what's there now, but they're back in two weeks. Based on what you're telling me — [kids outside / entertaining / it's been bad] — you really want ongoing protection so you're not calling us every few weeks."

**CSR:** "Most of our customers do one of two things:
- **Monthly** — we come every 4 weeks, $[X]/month
- **Bi-weekly** — every 2 weeks for max protection, $[X]/month

Which sounds better for your situation?"

**[They pick]**

**CSR:** "Perfect choice. Let me get your info and we'll get you on the schedule. Can I get the card you'd like on file?"

## SCENARIO 2: Existing Customer Calls to Schedule

**Customer:** "Hey, I need to schedule my next treatment."

**CSR:** "Sure! I've got your account pulled up. Before I book that — I'm seeing you're on our basic barrier service. How's that been working for you?"

**[Listen for complaints, "it's okay," or "we still see some"]**

**If they mention ANY issues:**

**CSR:** "Yeah, that's what I thought. Basic coverage works for small yards, but honestly, based on your property size, I don't think it's giving you full protection."

**CSR:** "A lot of customers in your area switched to Premium — it covers ticks and fleas too, and we treat the full perimeter. It's only $[X] more per visit."

**CSR:** "Want me to upgrade you starting this visit, or keep it basic for now?"

**[They pick]**

**CSR:** "Done. I've got you scheduled for [date]. Anything else I can help with?"

---

## SCENARIO 3: Customer Mentions an Event

**Customer:** [Anytime they mention a party, graduation, wedding, cookout...]

**CSR:** "Oh nice! When's the event?"

**CSR:** "So here's what I'd recommend — our regular service is great for ongoing protection, but for a big event you want our **Special Event Spray**. We come out 24-48 hours before, do an extra-strength treatment, and guarantee no mosquitoes for your guests."

**CSR:** "Want me to add that to your account for [date], or just keep your regular schedule?"

---

## DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (To Prescribe the Right Solution)

Ask these early in the call:

- "What's going on that made you call today?"
- "How big is your yard — small/medium/large?"
- "Do you have kids or pets that play outside?"
- "Any water features, pools, or wooded areas nearby?"
- "Have you tried anything else that didn't work?"
- "Any upcoming events or parties this season?"

**Use their answers in your Prescribe step!**

## HANDLING "LET ME THINK ABOUT IT"

**Customer:** "Let me talk to my spouse / think about it..."

**CSR:** "Totally understand. Quick question though — is it the price, or just wanting to make sure it's worth it?"

**If price:**
"I get it. But here's the math — one-time is $[X]. When mosquitoes come back in 2-3 weeks, that's another $[X]. Two more calls and you've spent more than a full season of recurring. Recurring actually saves you money."

**If unsure:**
"We guarantee our service. If you're not happy between visits, we come back free. No risk to try it."

**Then:**
"Tell you what — I'll set you up for monthly. Try it for the first month, and if you hate it, cancel anytime. Fair?"
