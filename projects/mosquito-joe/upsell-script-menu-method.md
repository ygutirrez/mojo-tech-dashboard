# Mosquito Joe — Menu Upsell Script
*Based on Alex Hormozi's "Menu Upsell" Framework*

---

## The Framework (Quick Refresher)
1. **Unsell** — "I don't think you need that."
2. **Prescribe** — "Given the [variables], you want this type of service."
3. **Choice** — "A or B?"
4. **Card on file** — "Awesome."

---

## Scenario 1: One-Time Customer → Recurring Service

**When:** After completing a one-time treatment, or when a customer calls for a single spray.

### The Script:

**Tech/Rep:** "So you mentioned you want a one-time treatment. Honestly? I don't think that's what you need."

**[Pause — let them react]**

**Tech/Rep:** "Here's why — mosquitoes breed every 7-10 days. A one-time spray kills what's here now, but in two weeks, you're back to square one. Given that you've got [standing water nearby / lots of shade / kids playing outside / you're hosting events this summer], you really want ongoing protection."

**Tech/Rep:** "Most of our customers do one of two things:
- **Monthly service** — we come out every 4 weeks, keeps it consistent
- **Bi-weekly service** — we come every 2 weeks, maximum protection

Which one sounds better for your situation?"

**[They pick one]**

**Tech/Rep:** "Awesome. Let me get your card on file so we can get you scheduled. You can cancel anytime, but honestly, once people start, they never go back."

---

## Scenario 2: Basic Service → Premium/Add-Ons

**When:** Customer is already on recurring, or during the initial signup.

### The Script:

**Tech/Rep:** "Now, regular barrier treatment handles most of the problem. But I'm looking at your yard and honestly, I don't think basic is going to cut it for you."

**[Pause]**

**Tech/Rep:** "You've got [a lot of trees / water features / a big property / dogs that track stuff in]. Given that, you probably want our Premium Protection — it includes tick and flea treatment too, and we hit the areas basic service doesn't cover."

**Tech/Rep:** "Here's what most people in your situation do:
- **Premium Protection** — covers mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas, full yard coverage
- **Premium Plus** — same thing, but we also treat your fence line and do a natural repellent zone around your patio

Which one works for you?"

**[They pick]**

**Tech/Rep:** "Perfect. I'll update your service. Same billing day, just upgraded protection."

---

## Scenario 3: Handling the "Let Me Think About It"

**Customer:** "Let me think about it..."

**Tech/Rep:** "Totally get it. But let me ask you this — what's making you hesitate? Is it the price, or are you just not sure if it'll work?"

**[If price]:**
"Look, a one-time treatment is $[X]. If you need to call us back in 3 weeks because mosquitoes are back, that's another $[X]. Two more calls and you've paid more than a whole season of recurring. The math doesn't make sense for one-time."

**[If unsure it'll work]:**
"We guarantee it. If you're not happy, we come back for free. No questions. But honestly? We don't get many callbacks. This stuff works."

## Key Variables to Listen For (Prescribe Step)

Use these to customize your prescription:

| They mention... | Prescribe... |
|----------------|--------------|
| Kids playing outside | Recurring + natural options |
| Pool or water features | Premium (tick/flea combo) |
| Dogs/pets | Premium Protection |
| Hosting a party/event | Add special event spray |
| Large property | Premium Plus with perimeter |
| "It's been really bad" | Bi-weekly instead of monthly |
| Shade/trees/woods nearby | Premium + more frequent visits |

---

## The Close (Card on File)

Always end with the assumptive close:

✅ **"Awesome. Let me get your card on file."**
✅ **"Perfect. I'll get you on the schedule."**
✅ **"Great choice. Let me set that up."**

Never ask: "So... do you want to do it?" — that invites hesitation.

---

## Training Notes

- Practice the **pause** after the Unsell — it creates curiosity
- The **Prescribe** step requires actually looking at their yard and situation
- Always give exactly **2 choices** — not 1, not 3
- The **Card on File** close assumes the sale — confidence is key
