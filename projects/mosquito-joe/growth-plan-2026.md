## Retention: Stop the Leak

You can't fill a leaky bucket. Before spending $200K on acquisition, fix retention.

### Questions to Answer
- [ ] What's current churn rate? (% customers who don't return)
- [ ] Why do customers leave? (Price? Service quality? Moved?)
- [ ] What's the reactivation rate on lapsed customers?

### Retention Tactics ($30K budget)
| Tactic | Cost | Expected Impact |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **Email nurture sequences** | $5K | Keep top of mind |
| **Seasonal reminders** | $3K | "It's mosquito season!" |
| **Loyalty discount (year 2+)** | $10K | 5% off for renewals |
| **Win-back campaign** | $7K | Target lapsed customers |
| **NPS surveys + follow-up** | $5K | Catch issues early |

**Goal:** Reduce churn by 5 percentage points = ~$100K saved revenue
