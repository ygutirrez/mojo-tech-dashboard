# MoJoe AI Assistant - Elevator Pitch

## 30-Second Version

> "What if you had a full-time assistant who knew your business inside and out — answered questions, pulled reports, managed your calendar, drafted emails, and never took a day off?
>
> That's what we built for ourselves at Mosquito Joe of Miami. Now we're offering it to other franchisees.
>
> It connects to your GHL, your calendar, your ads — and you just text it like you would an employee. 'Hey, how did we do on sales this week?' Done. 'Schedule a reminder to call that lead tomorrow.' Done.
>
> We handle the setup. You just use it. $299 a month."

## 60-Second Version

> "Running a Mosquito Joe franchise means wearing a lot of hats — sales, operations, marketing, HR. You're busy. Things slip through the cracks.
>
> We built an AI assistant specifically for MoJo owners. His name is MoJoe.
>
> Text him: 'How are my Google Ads performing?' — he pulls the report.
> Text him: 'Remind me to follow up with the Smiths on Friday.' — done.
> Text him: 'Draft an email to my team about tomorrow's route changes.' — written and ready.
>
> He connects to your GHL, your calendar, your CRM. He learns your business. And he works 24/7.
>
> We've been using him at Mosquito Joe of Miami for months. It's like having a $50K executive assistant for a fraction of the cost.
>
> Setup takes a week. We handle everything. Then it's $299 a month — less than one day of a part-time employee.
>
> Want me to show you what it can do?"

## Key Talking Points

**Pain points we solve:**
- "I don't have time to check all my dashboards"
- "Things fall through the cracks"
- "I wish I had an assistant but can't afford one"
- "I'm not tech-savvy but I know I need to use AI somehow"

**Objection handling:**

*"I'm not technical."*
> "You don't need to be. You just text it like you would a person. We handle all the tech stuff."

*"What if it makes mistakes?"*
> "It's a tool, not a replacement for your judgment. It drafts things for your approval, pulls reports, sets reminders. You're always in control."

*"$299/month sounds expensive."*
> "What's an hour of your time worth? If MoJoe saves you 5 hours a week, that's 20 hours a month. At $50/hour, that's $1,000 in time back — for $299."

*"Is this just ChatGPT?"*
> "ChatGPT is general purpose. MoJoe is connected to YOUR systems — your GHL, your calendar, your ads. It knows your business, your team, your customers."
