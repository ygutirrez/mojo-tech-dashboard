## Step 1: Pre-Launch Checklist

### Required Before Starting:
- [ ] Google Ads account active
- [ ] Google Business Profile linked and verified
- [ ] Conversion tracking set up (calls, form fills, bookings)

---

## Step 2: Campaign Structure

### Recommended: Single PMax Campaign with Multiple Asset Groups

For MoJo, I recommend **ONE Performance Max campaign** with **3 Asset Groups**:

| Asset Group | Target Audience | Focus |
|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Barrier Spray Services** | Homeowners, outdoor entertainers | Core service - mosquito treatments |
| **Misting Systems** | High-value homes, outdoor kitchens | Premium upsell - automated misting |
| **Special Offers** | Price-sensitive, first-time customers | $40 Off, seasonal promos |

**Why this structure:**
- Google recommends consolidation (max 100 campaigns, but fewer = better AI learning)
- Asset groups let you tailor messaging to different intents
- Single budget optimizes across all asset groups automatically

---

## Step 3: Campaign Settings

### Basic Settings:
```
Campaign Name: MoJo Miami - Performance Max 2026
Campaign Goal: Leads
Bidding Strategy: Maximize Conversions (or Target CPA once you have data)
Budget: Start at $50-100/day (scale based on performance)

```

### Important Settings:

**Final URL Expansion:** `OFF` (recommended)

---

## Step 4: Asset Group Setup

### For Each Asset Group, You Need:

#### Text Assets:
| Type | Quantity | Character Limit |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Headlines | 5-15 | 30 characters |
| Long Headlines | 1-5 | 90 characters |
| Descriptions | 2-5 | 90 characters |
| Business Name | 1 | 25 characters |

#### Image Assets:
| Type | Quantity | Specs |
|------|----------|-------|
| Landscape | 3+ | 1200x628 (1.91:1) |
| Square | 3+ | 1200x1200 (1:1) |
| Portrait | 1+ | 960x1200 (4:5) |
| Logo (square) | 1 | 1200x1200 |
| Logo (landscape) | 1 | 1200x300 |

#### Video Assets:
| Type | Length | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Horizontal | 10-60 sec | Best for YouTube |
| Vertical | 10-60 sec | For Shorts/Stories |
| Square | 10-60 sec | For Discovery/Feed |

**Pro Tip:** If you don't have videos, PMax will auto-generate them from your images. But custom videos perform 20-30% better.
