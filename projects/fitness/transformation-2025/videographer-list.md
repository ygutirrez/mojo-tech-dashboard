## QUESTIONS TO ASK

- Have you shot fitness transformation content before? Can I see examples?
- Do you edit as well, or just shoot?
- What's your rate for a multi-month project (not just one day)?
- Can you do YouTube-optimized formats (16:9, vertical for shorts)?
- What's your turnaround time on edits?
- Are you available to shoot weekly/bi-weekly as progress happens?
