# The Back Nine - Franchise Analysis

**Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Status:** Exploratory - Next step: Franchisor call  
**Partners:** 4 (including Yoel)

---

## Executive Summary

Indoor golf simulator franchise. New system (franchising since 2022) but interesting economics for a multi-territory play. The "no employees" semi-passive model is attractive, but single-territory margins are thin — multi-unit strategy is the right approach.

## 4-Partner Math

### Single Territory (DON'T DO THIS)
```
Gross Revenue:        $194,856
- Royalty (8%):       -$15,589
Net after royalty:    $179,267
- Operating expenses: -$100,000 (est: rent, utilities, maintenance, insurance)
Operating profit:     ~$79,000
÷ 4 partners:         ~$20,000/partner/year
```
**Verdict:** Not worth it for 4 partners.

### 3-Territory Strategy (THE PLAY)
```
Territory Fees:       $140,000 (discounted from $148,500)
Total Investment:     ~$900K - $1.8M (3x build-out)

Potential Gross (3x): $584,568
- Royalty (8%):       -$46,765
Net after royalty:    $537,803
- Operating (3 loc):  -$250,000 (economies of scale)
Operating profit:     ~$287,000
÷ 4 partners:         ~$72,000/partner/year
```
**Plus:** Equity value for exit, scalable to more territories.
