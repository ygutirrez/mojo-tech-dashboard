# Workflows

## 📱 Shorts/Reels Capture

**How to use:**
1. See a video you like on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.
2. Copy the link
3. Send it to MoJoe on Slack with a quick note (optional)
   - Example: "https://instagram.com/reel/xyz save this - good hook idea"
   - Example: "https://tiktok.com/@user/video/123 recreate for MoJo"

**What MoJoe does:**
- Logs it in `/inbox/shorts-reels/QUEUE.md`
- Downloads the video when possible
- Analyzes the content (hook, format, what makes it work)
- Creates an action plan:
  - Recreate for your brand?
  - Save as reference/inspiration?
  - Extract the hook/idea?
  - Ignore?

**Check status:** Ask "what's in my reels queue?"
