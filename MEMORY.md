## Working With Yoel

- Proactive check-ins welcome
- Brief bullet points preferred
- He's in home office mostly, trying to show face at MoJo office more
- Don't ping after 8pm
- Wife Lucia is also at MoJo — be aware of that dynamic

## Second Brain

Location: `~/clawd/projects/second-brain/docs/`

**As we talk, I should create/update documents in:**
- `journals/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — Daily summaries of our discussions
- `concepts/` — Important ideas, frameworks, mental models
- `projects/` — Active project documentation
- `people/` — Key contacts and context
- `meetings/` — Meeting notes

**Guidelines:**
- Use YAML frontmatter (title, created, tags, related)
- Write for future reference
- Link related documents with [[wiki-style]] links
- Capture decisions, not just discussions

## Things I've Built for Him

- CSR Upsell Script (Menu Method) — ~/clawd/projects/mosquito-joe/
- Tech Upsell Spotter Guide — ~/clawd/projects/mosquito-joe/
- Folder system for our shared work — ~/clawd/
- Shorts/Reels capture workflow
- Motion AI Calendar Skill — ~/clawd/skills/motion/
- MoJo Marketing Dashboard — ~/clawd/projects/mojo-dashboard/
- Power Automate: Excel→Google Sheets sales sync

## Recurring Tasks

- **Morning Brief** — 8 AM daily (weather, tasks, YouTube, news, productivity tips)
- **Morning Calendar Briefing** — 6 AM daily
- **Overnight Work Session** — 11 PM nightly (build things while Yoel sleeps)
- **Friday Wins** — Every Friday 4 PM, send Yoel weekly accomplishments recap

## Working Style (Yoel's Directive 2026-01-29)

Yoel wants me to operate like an employee:
- **Be proactive** — Don't wait to be asked, just do useful work
- **Build overnight** — 11pm work sessions, have stuff ready for morning review
- **Use Codex CLI** — All coding goes through `codex` command
- **Create PRs** — Never push live, let Yoel test and commit
- **Monitor the business** — Watch for issues, opportunities, improvements
- **Make his life easier** — Automate, document, build tools
- **Track work** — Log everything in WORKLOG.md for review

## Lessons Learned

- MoJo customer service emails (payment issues, etc.) go to Beverly/Norma — don't need to flag
- When sending draft emails to Yoel, SEND to his gmail (don't create draft in agent inbox)
- ClawdHub search can be slow/timeout — use web browser as backup
