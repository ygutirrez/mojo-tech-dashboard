## MoJo Financial Deep Dive

Yoel sent 3 years of P&L statements (2023, 2024, 2025) for analysis. Key findings:

### Revenue Trend
| Year | Revenue | Change |
|------|---------|--------|
| 2023 | $2,678,248 | — |
| 2024 | $2,660,198 | -0.7% |
| 2025 | $3,027,366 | +13.8% |

### Critical Insight
**The mosquito business has been FLAT for 3 years.** The 2025 "growth" was a ONE-TIME government contract:
- **Alligator Alcatraz** — government mosquito spraying contract, ~$366K
- Contract is NOT long-term
- Currently ON HOLD
- Should not be counted as sustainable revenue

**Adjusted reality:**
- 2023: $2.68M
- 2024: $2.66M
- 2025: $2.66M (excluding Alligator Alcatraz)

**Three years of flat revenue.** The stagnation is real and the windfall masked it.

### Cost Issues Identified
- **Auto insurance:** $127K (4.2% of revenue) — should be 2-3%, shop this aggressively
- **CC processing:** $71K (2.3%) — industry avg is 1.5-2%, renegotiate
- **Marketing cut:** Went from $266K (9.9%) in 2023 to $168K (5.5%) in 2025 — may be starving growth
- **Direct labor:** Up 32% while revenue up only 13% — efficiency declining

### Quick Win Opportunities
- Shop auto insurance: $25-40K savings potential
- Renegotiate CC fees: $10-15K savings
- Tighten discount policy: $10-20K
- Total potential: $80-140K in savings/efficiency

### 2026 Growth Plan
Yoel has allocated **$200K additional marketing budget** for 2026 to drive real growth.
- Goal: $5M in 3-4 years (from ~$2.66M baseline)
- Requires ~20% annual growth
- 2026 target: $3.2M (+$540K)
- Strategy: Heavy investment in PPC, LSA, direct mail, referrals + fixing retention

2. What's the margin comparison: pest vs mosquito?
3. What's happening to mosquito customer count?
