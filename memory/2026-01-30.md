# 2026-01-30 (Thursday)

## Google Fit Integration
- Built `~/clawd/tools/google-fit/gfit` CLI to pull weight & body fat from Google Fit
- Auth'd to ygutierrez@gmail.com via OAuth (credentials in `~/.config/google-fit/`)
- Data source: Hume Body Pod syncing via `fittrackhealth.pro` app
- Commands: `gfit weight`, `gfit bodyfat`, `gfit sources`, `gfit auth`

### Current Stats (as of Jan 24)
- Weight: 191.8 lbs (down 4.6 lbs since Jan 13)
- Body Fat: 20.2%
- Lean Mass: 153.1 lbs

## Life Dashboard Updates
- Added Body Composition card with weight, body fat, change, lean mass
- Added weight trend chart (Chart.js) showing progress over time
- Created `update-dashboard.py` to refresh data from Google Fit
- Updated morning-brief cron to include dashboard screenshot

## Diet Tracking Plan (Ready to Start)
- Yoel will send food pics
- I estimate calories/macros
- Track against weight trend
- Optimize meals based on progress

## MoJo Creative App - MVP Complete
- Added 4 new features to the content generator:
  1. **Franchise Location** - personalizes captions with "Mosquito Joe of [City]"
  2. **Platform Selector** - Instagram Post (square), Story (vertical), Facebook (landscape)
  3. **Custom Description** - text box for specific content requests
  4. **Logo Toggle** - instructs AI to leave space for logo placement
- App confirmed working, generating images via OpenAI gpt-image-1
- Running at localhost:3001

### V2 Features (added to ClickUp MoJoe Tasks)
1. Logo overlay (actual image processing)
2. Gemini/Flux as alternative AI providers
3. Save generation history
4. User auth + Stripe billing
5. Deploy to Vercel

### Notes
- Yoel asked about "Gemini Banana" → clarified he meant Gemini/Flux
- Sticking with OpenAI for now
- Cost: ~$0.12-0.15 per generation (3 images + captions)

## Sales Dashboard Update
- Changed cron job from 6:30 AM to **7:30 AM** (sales export arrives later than expected)
- Job ID: 3e5b7414-117a-406a-b7f5-3a57063baecb

### TV Display Requirement (added 1/30)
- Dashboard needs to be displayed on office TV for team visibility
- Must auto-refresh regularly (no manual intervention)
- Options to explore:
  - Raspberry Pi / Fire TV Stick running browser in kiosk mode
  - Auto-refresh meta tag or JS interval in the dashboard HTML
  - Scheduled page reload every X minutes

### January 2026 MTD Stats (as of 1/30)
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Sales | 12 |
| Cancels | 35 |
| **Net** | **-23** |

**Top Cancel Reasons:**
- Paused/WP: 17 (49%)
- Moved: 9 (26%)
- Not Interested: 5 (14%)
- Financial: 4 (11%)

**Sales by CSR:** Lucy 5, Bev 4, Norma 3
**Cancels by CSR:** Norma 20, Lucy 13, Bev 2

⚠️ Net -23 is concerning. Paused/WP is #1 reason - potential win-back campaign opportunity as spring approaches.
