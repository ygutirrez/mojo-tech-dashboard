# 2026-01-28 — Daily Notes

## MoJo Marketing Campaign

- **Omar** (Yoel's partner) came up with a "Year of Giving Back" marketing campaign using ChatGPT
- I reviewed it — good bones but too focused on rewarding existing customers, not driving growth
- Key feedback: Q2 referral piece is strong, but quarterly giveaways don't drive behavior
- Created a refined "Spread the Word, Not the Bugs" growth-focused version:
  - Year-round referral program ($50 credit per referral, $25 off for new customer)
  - Quarterly leaderboard with tiered rewards
  - Commercial "Partner Program" for B2B
- Drafted response email to Omar — Yoel sent it with his own tweaks
- **Status:** Waiting on Omar's response

## MoJo Sales/Cancel KPI Dashboard

- Built new dashboard: `projects/mojo-dashboard/sales-kpi-dashboard.html`
- Data source: SharePoint Excel sheet (manually exported for now)
- **January 5-28, 2026 snapshot:**
  - Sales: 12
  - Cancels: 28
  - Net: **-16** (customer base shrinking)
  - Cancel rate: 70%
- Top cancel reasons: Paused/WP (46%), Moved (32%), Not Interested (18%), Financial (14%)
- CSR breakdown: Bev best ratio (4 sales/2 cancels), Norma handles most cancels (possibly retention role)
- **Action needed:** Set up automated access to SharePoint data (discussed Options: Google Sheets mirror, Power Automate, or Graph API)

## Piper Insurance

- Reminded Yoel about 11:30 AM call for Piper (Cherokee Six) insurance
- Status of aircraft: awaiting airworthiness certificate, fresh repaint, engine rebuilt

## Small Stuff

- Helped with Excel Named Range for dropdown list in "Office Tracking and Stats" sheet
- Yoel set up Gmail filter to auto-star emails from mojoeagent@gmail.com
- Quick question about 3D-printable hose fitting for MoJo trucks (180° return bend to hang on blower tank)
